            I began my journey as a software developer from a chef. I spent most
            my working life in the kitchen, building teams, creating menus,
            living a very fast paced life. Unfortunately I was in a motorcycle
            accident where I was not able to return to my culinary feild. I was
            yearning for something to expand my creativity, I had a passion for
            technology growing up, I even got an award in grade 8 for helping
            with the technology so often. I knew I could find something out
            there where I could create and enjoy what I did. I began to discover
            all these free online resources where one could build a career in a
            couple of lessons. I was definitely intrigued by this statement, I
            decided to dig in deeper. I was taking every free course I could get
            my hands on, doing tutorial after tutorial. Finally, a few months
            later I decided that yes this is what I want to do with the rest of
            my life. I started to reach out to individuals in my community, and
            started getting a conversation going. I found that alot of people in
            the industry were fond of these bootcamps where you can enhance
            yours skills with a 500-hour intense training camp, so I decided to
            pursure that next. I started doing some research and started
            visiting thsese schools to get a better feel of how it would be like
            to be in this industry. Once I found my met I knew I was going to
            build something great. Every day I put time in to work on something
            that I enjoy making, whether it be something new or something I toss
            out at the end of the day. I always try and build something new. I
            love discovering new ways to do things, new methods, new languages,
            things to make my life easier. I mean don't we all want to make life
            a little easy sometimes. I know I have just begun but I cannot wait
            to explore this indulging industry.
