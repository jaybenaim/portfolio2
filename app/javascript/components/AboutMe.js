              I began my journey as a software developer from a chef. I spent
              most my working life in the kitchen, building teams, creating
              menus, living a very fast paced enviornmnet. Unfortunately, I was
              in a motorcycle accident, but greatfully it led me to discover my
              passion for the software industry. I was yearning for something to
              expand my creativity, I knew I could find something out there
              where I could create and enjoy what I did. I began to discover
              free online resources and advertisements offering accelerated
              programs to build a new carrer. I was definitely intrigued by this
              statement, I decided to dig in deeper. I was taking every free
              course I could get my hands on, doing tutorial after tutorial.
              Building project after project, I always had a lot of ideas, and
              now the ability to pursure them has become my journey.

              A few months later I decided that software developing is what I
              want to do with the rest of my life. I started to reach out to
              individuals in my community and started getting a conversation
              going. I found that a lot of people in the industry were fond of
              these bootcamps where you can enhance yours skills with a 500-hour
              intense training camp, so I decided to pursure that next. I
              started doing some research and started visiting thsese schools to
              get a better feel of how it would be like to be in this industry.
              Once I found my match I knew I was going to build something great.
              Every day I put time in to work on something that I enjoy making.
              I always try and build something with new technology always trying
              to expand my knowledge. I love discovering new ways to do things,
              new methods, new languages, things to make all of our lives
              easier. I know I have just begun but I cannot wait to explore this
              indulging industry and all the great endorphines it brings.
